# W101TeleportTrainer
An external hack that attaches to the Wizard101 game and changes your coordinates to whatever you input.

This hack will discontinue working after each update to the game because the coordinate pointers will change. If it isn't working, wait for me to update it with the up-to-date pointer.

This is for educational purposes only, and not to be used for any kind of unlawful behavior.
